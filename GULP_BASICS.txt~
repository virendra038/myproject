# watch task

	gulp.task('watch',function(){

		gulp.watch('app/js/**/*.js',['scripts']);
	});

	watch js for all files ending in .js then on change run 'script' task

	*.+(js|css) matches all files in the root directory ending in .js or .css


NOTES: 1. use gulp-plumber it will not kick you out if there is any mistake in syntax

2. use uglify for the minification of the file
