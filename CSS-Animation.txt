1. use transition-property & transition-duration with hover
2. vendor prefixes   -webkit- (chrome/safari) -moz- -o-, -ms-


or -webkit-transtition: border-radius 2s 4s,background-color,3s 4s;


2D transform methods

skew(X,Y);
skewX();
skewY();

Scale(widthmultiplier,heightmultiplier);

rotate(deg);

Translate(X-axis,Y);

.box{                                    

	transition: transform 2s ease-out

use cubic;
}

.box{
transform: skewX(20deg)

}

transition timing functions:

ease()default
start slow
end slow

linear

ease in slow start 

ease out end slow

ease-in-out
start slow end slow

use cubic-bezier for customizing the properties of timing functions

tranform in 3D space

translate 3d(x,y,z);

Positions:


fixed: will get ignored from the browser and the other conponents

absolute: will get ignored only by the other components //the insiders of absolute will follow to parent

relative: will get ignored by the other components but original space will get maintained 

and everyrhing will be according to its relative position


absolute inside relative will behave like absulte inside relative & will respond according to the parent

top,bottom,left,right will only work with the position other than static ,,basically static means no position

inherit will inherit the parent's property


float property: other elements will not ignore the height and width but the element will be removed from the doc flow
/// the same tag elements will ignore the hight too
use clear with float
